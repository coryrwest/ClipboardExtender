ClipboardExtender
=================

Done:
- App starts in tray
- Has double click and right click action/menu
- method for getting clipboard text
- Form shows on clipboard change

Need to be done:
- Set up global keyboard hooks (class already built)
- tie in storage of multiple clipboard elements
- fade out notifications

Global hooks not working. Doesnt recognize when Modifiers are pressed (ctrl, alt, shift)
