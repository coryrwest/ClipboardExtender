ClipboardExtender
=================

Done:
- App starts in tray
- Has double click and right click action/menu
- method for getting clipboard text

Need to be done:
- Set up global keyboard hooks (class already built)
- tie in storage of multiple clipboard elements
- fade out notifications
- get clipboardmonitor to show on clipboard change.

Global hooks not working. Doesnt recognize when Modifiers are pressed (ctrl, alt, shift)
